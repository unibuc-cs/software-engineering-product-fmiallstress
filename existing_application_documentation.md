### 3. Software Architecture Report 
#### a) What are the technologies that you have used, and why? 
- The backend is written in <b>C#</b> for using multple frameworks such as:
    - <b><i>Identity</b></i> for user entity
    - <b><i>Fake it Easy</b></i> for unit testing
    - <b><i>Binance</b></i> for real time currencies values
    - <b><i>OpenAI</b></i> for AI incorporation
- The frontend is written with <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>Vue.js</b> from previous experiences of the developers and easy design of components

#### b) What are the architectural patterns you have implemented and were they appropriate, and why? 
- We implemented the <b>Repository-Service</b> design pattern in the backend to streamline database interactions, making the code cleaner and more manageable.

#### c) Were the coding principles established enforced successfully? 
- We've tried to establish a certain directory and file structure to keep everything at place for better organization. For example,
    - for the backend : Controllers, Models, Repositories, Services etc.
    - for the frontend: assets, components, router, etc

- Also, for model names and attribues we've got CamelCase

#### d) What are the faults that were discovered during development that havenâ€™t been addressed by the time of delivery? 
- There is an open issue regarding a wrong RSI value for the input data
- A page is hardcoded in frontend for the moment

#### e) Does any part of the project require refactoring? 
- For the moment the code base seems well built and modular. There is no refactoring planned yet.
